## History States

A history state is a special type of state that remembers the last active state within a compound state. This allows you to resume from where you left off when re-entering a compound state.

#### Example

Let's consider an example of a payment form with two payment methods: card and PayPal. The user can switch between the card and PayPal payment methods. When the user enters their address, they can go back to the payment method they were using.

#### Code

In XState, you can define a history state by setting the `type` property to `"history"` in the state configuration:

```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as
      | { type: "use.paypal" }
      | { type: "use.card" }
      | { type: "enter.address" }
      | { type: "go.back" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  context: {},
  initial: "payment",
  states: {
    payment: {
      initial: "card",
      on: {
        "enter.address": {
          target: "address",
        },
      },
      states: {
        card: {
          on: {
            "use.paypal": {
              target: "paypal",
            },
          },
        },
        paypal: {
          on: {
            "use.card": {
              target: "card",
            },
          },
        },
        hist: {
          type: "history",
        },
      },
    },
    address: {
      on: {
        "go.back": {
          target: "payment.hist",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine in our React component, we'll use the `useMachine` hook again:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);
  const isEnteringAddress = state.matches("address");

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {state.matches("payment") && (
          <>
            <h2>
              <pre>{JSON.stringify(state.value, null, 2)}</pre>
            </h2>
            <h3>Payment method:</h3>
            <label htmlFor="card">Card</label>
            <input
              type="radio"
              name="card"
              id="card"
              value="card"
              checked={state.matches({ payment: "card" })}
              onChange={() => send({ type: "use.card" })}
            />
            <label htmlFor="paypal">Paypal</label>
            <input
              type="radio"
              name="paypal"
              id="paypal"
              value="paypal"
              checked={state.matches({ payment: "paypal" })}
              onChange={() => send({ type: "use.paypal" })}
            />
          </>
        )}
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="address"></label>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            send({ type: isEnteringAddress ? "go.back" : "enter.address" })
          }
        >
          {isEnteringAddress ? "Go back" : "Enter address"}
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can see an example of this in the code editor to you right.

##### Key Points

- We use the `type: "history"` property to define a history state.
- We use the `target` property to transition to the history state.

#### Exercise

1. Create a new XState machine with the following states:

   - `subscription (initial, parent)`
     - `free (initial)`
     - `pro`
     - `hist`
   - `name`

2. Add transitions between the states as follows:
   - From `subscription` to `name` on the `enter.name` event.
   - From `free` to `pro` on the `set.pro` event.
   - From `pro` to `free` on the `set.free` event.
   - From `name` to `subscription.hist` on the `go.back` event.

#### Summary

In this lesson, you learned about history states in XState. History states are useful for resuming from where you left off when re-entering a compound state. You can define a history state by setting the `type` property to `"history"` in the state configuration.
