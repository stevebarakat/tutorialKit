## Compound States

In this lesson, we'll get familiar with compound (or parent/child) states. Compound states are states that contain other states. They are useful for organizing and structuring complex state machines. Compound states can have nested states, which can have their own nested states, and so on. This allows you to create a hierarchical structure of states that can represent complex behavior.

We'll also use a special kind of transition called a "delayed transition" to transition from one state to another after a certain amount of time has passed. This is useful for emulating the time it takes for a process to complete, such as a loading a media player.

Let's take a look at an example of a simple state machine with compound states (technically a statechart). This statechart represents an arcane technology called a CD player üòÅ, in which the CDs are placed in a tray and mechnically closed. It can be in one of three states:

- "Opened", "Closed", and "Closing".
- The "Closed" state is a parent state.
- It has three child states: "Stopped", "Playing", and "Paused".
- The "Closing" state transitions to the "Closed" state after 1500ms.

#### Code

Here's the code in XState:

```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as
      | { type: "OPEN" }
      | { type: "PLAY" }
      | { type: "STOP" }
      | { type: "PAUSE" }
      | { type: "CLOSE" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  initial: "Opened",
  states: {
    Opened: {
      on: {
        CLOSE: {
          target: "Closing",
        },
      },
    },
    Closing: {
      after: {
        "1500": {
          target: "Closed",
        },
      },
    },
    Closed: {
      initial: "Stopped",
      on: {
        OPEN: {
          target: "Opened",
        },
      },
      states: {
        Stopped: {
          on: {
            PLAY: {
              target: "Playing",
            },
          },
        },
        Playing: {
          on: {
            PAUSE: {
              target: "Paused",
            },
            STOP: {
              target: "Stopped",
            },
          },
        },
        Paused: {
          on: {
            PLAY: {
              target: "Playing",
            },
            STOP: {
              target: "Stopped",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine in our React component, we'll use the `useMachine` hook again:

```tsx
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);
  const isPlaying = state.matches({ Closed: "Playing" });
  const isOpened = state.matches("Opened");
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{JSON.stringify(state.value)}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: isOpened ? "CLOSE" : "OPEN",
          })
        }
      >
        {isOpened ? "close" : "open"}
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: isPlaying ? "PAUSE" : "PLAY",
          })
        }
      >
        {isPlaying ? "pause" : "play"}
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={isOpened || !isPlaying}
        onClick={() => {
          send({ type: "STOP" });
        }}
      >
        stop
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### Key Points

- We're using the `matches` method to check if the current state matches a specific state.
- We're using the `after` property to transition to another state after a certain amount of time has passed. In this case, we're transitioning from the "Closing" state to the "Closed.Playing" state after 1500ms.

##### In Practice

You can see an example of this in the code editor to you right. Click the button in the preview panel to toggle betweeen states. Notice how the button's text changes from "On" to "Off" and back again, reflecting the current state of the machine.

#### Exercise

1. Create a new state machine that represents a coffee machine. The coffee machine should have the following states:

- "preparation" (initial state, parent state)
  - "idle"
  - "weighed"
  - "ground"
- "brewing"
- "ready" (final state)

2. The coffee machine should transition from "idle" to "weighed" when the "weigh" event is sent.
3. The coffee machine should transition from "weighed" to "ground" when the "grind" event is sent.
4. The coffee machine should transition from "ground" to "brewing" when the "brew" event is sent.
5. The coffee machine should transition from "brewing" to "ready" after 3000ms.
6. Make the "ready" state a "final" state by using the `type: "final"` property. For example:
   `ready: {
  type: "final",
}`
   This prevents the machine from transitioning to any other state after reaching the "ready" state.
7. Create a React component that uses the `useMachine` hook to interact with the coffee machine.

#### Summary

In this lesson, we learned about compound states and how they can be used to organize complex state machines. We also learned how to use delayed transitions to transition from one state to another after a certain amount of time has passed. We also implemented our first "final" state.

In the next lesson, we'll learn about parallel states and how they can be used to model concurrent behavior.
