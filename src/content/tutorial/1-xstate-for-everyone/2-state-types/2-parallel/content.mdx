## Parallel States

Parallel states are used to model concurrent behavior in a state machine. They allow multiple states to exist independently of each other.

For example, a media player might have a "track" state that represents the current track being played and a "mute" state that represents if the track is being muted. These two states can exist independently of each other and can transition between their respective child states without affecting each other.

#### Code

Here's the code in XState:

```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    context: {} as {},
    events: {} as
      | { type: "PLAY" }
      | { type: "PAUSE" }
      | { type: "MUTE" }
      | { type: "UNMUTE" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  context: {},
  id: "player",
  type: "parallel",
  states: {
    track: {
      initial: "paused",
      states: {
        paused: {
          on: {
            PLAY: {
              target: "playing",
            },
          },
        },
        playing: {
          on: {
            PAUSE: {
              target: "paused",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    mute: {
      initial: "unmuted",
      states: {
        unmuted: {
          on: {
            MUTE: {
              target: "muted",
            },
          },
        },
        muted: {
          on: {
            UNMUTE: {
              target: "unmuted",
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine in our React component, we'll use the `useMachine` hook again:

```tsx
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);
  const isPlaying = state.matches({ Track: "Playing" });
  const isMuted = state.matches({ mute: "Muted" });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{JSON.stringify(state.value)}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          send({ type: isMuted ? "UNMUTE" : "MUTE" });
        }}
      >
        {isMuted ? "unmute" : "mute"}
      </button>
      <button
        onClick={() =>
          send({
            type: isPlaying ? "PAUSE" : "PLAY",
          })
        }
      >
        {isPlaying ? "pause" : "play"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can see an example of this in the code editor to you right.

##### Key Points

- Parallel states are used to model concurrent behavior in a state machine.
- Parallel states allow multiple states to exist independently of each other.
- Parallel states can have child states that transition independently of each other.

#### Exercise

1. Create a state machine that models a thermostat with two parallel states: "fan" and "setting". The "fan" state should have two child states: "auto" and "on". The "setting" state should have two child states: "heating" and "cooling". The thermostat should have the following transitions:

   - When the "FAN.ON" event is sent, the fan should transition to the "on" state.
   - When the "FAN.AUTO" event is sent, the fan should transition to the "auto" state.
   - When the "COOL" event is sent, the setting should transition to the "cooling" state.
   - When the "HEAT" event is sent, the setting should transition to the "heating" state.

2. Implement the thermostat in a React component that displays the current state and has buttons to toggle the fan and setting states.
