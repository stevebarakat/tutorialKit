## Introducing Context

We use **state** to store _finite_ state. We use **context** to store _infinite_ state.

- finite state: a predefined set of states that a machine can be in.
- infinite state: state that has too many possible values to predefine. For example, the current volume of a music player.

In this excercise, we'll create a state machine that stores the current volume of a music player in `context`. Then we'll access `context` in a React component to display the volume.

#### Code

Here's the code for the state machine that stores the current volume in context:

```ts
import { setup } from "xstate";

export const machine = setup({
  types: {
    context: {} as { volume: number },
  },
}).createMachine({
  context: {
    volume: 50,
  },
  initial: "Idle",
  states: {
    Idle: {},
  },
});
```

To use this machine in a React component, we can use the `useMachine` hook from `@xstate/react`:

```tsx
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state] = useMachine(machine);
  const { volume } = state.context;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Volume: {volume}</p>
      <input type="range" value={volume} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### Key Points

- We use **context** to store the volume.
- We can access the current context using `state.context`.

##### In Practice

You can see the code in action in the editor. Try changing the volume using the range input. You'll notice that it doesn't update the volume. We'll fix this in the next lesson. For now, update the value of context in the code editor and see how it affects the React component.

#### Summary

In this lesson, we learned about context in XState. We use context to store _infinite_ state. We created a state machine that stores the current volume of a music player in context. We then used this machine in a React component to display the volume.
