## Getting Started with State Machines

State machines are a powerful tool for modeling complex software applications. They help you visualize the flow of your application and understand its possible states and transitions, resulting in more predictable and maintainable code.

#### Key Concepts

State machines are fininte, meaning they can only be in one **state** at a time. They **transition** between these states in response to **events**.

- **State**: Describes something's status at a give time, which could be as simple as "on" or "off".

- **Transition**: A change in state that happens when a condition is fulfilled or an event is received.

- **Event**: A signal that triggers a transition. For example, a button being clicked or a file getting finished loading.

Here's the <a href="https://stately.ai/registry/editor/6ad630e7-c4f1-40e5-8068-4c0a0398a8e9?machineId=a5701504-59a3-4092-9bd4-3972be705357&mode=design" alt="First Machine" target="_blank">model</a> for a simple state machine that transitions from "Off" to "On", or vice versa, when a "switch" event is received:

#### Code

In XState, a state machine is defined using a JSON-like object. Here's the same
state machine defined in <a href="https://stately.ai/docs/xstate" alt="XState" target="_blank">XState</a>:

```js
createMachine({
  initial: "Off",
  states: {
    Off: {
      on: {
        switch: {
          target: "On",
        },
      },
    },
    On: {
      on: {
        switch: {
          target: "Off",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To use this machine our app, we pass it to the `createActor` function provided by xstate. It returns an [actor](https://stately.ai/docs/actors) that we can `send` events to and `subscribe` to.

```js
const actor = createActor(machine).start();
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  actor.send({
    type: "switch",
  });
});

actor.subscribe((state) => {
  button.innerText = state.value;
});
```

##### Key Points

- The `start` method initializes the actor and transitions it to the initial state.
- The `send` method sends an event to the actor, which triggers a transition.
- The `subscribe` method listens for state changes and updates the button's text accordingly.

##### In Practice

You can see an example of this in the code editor to you right. Click the button in the preview panel to toggle betweeen states. Notice how the button's text changes from "On" to "Off" and back again, reflecting the current state of the machine.

#### Exercise

1. Change the event type from "switch" to "toggle" in the machine definition.
2. Update the event type in the `send` method to match the new event type.
3. Test the changes by clicking the button in the preview panel.
4. Change the the name of the first state from "Off" to "Inactive" and the second state from "On" to "Active".
5. Update the button's text to reflect the new state names.
6. Test the changes by clicking the button in the preview panel.

#### Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to create a simple state machine using XState and integrate it into a web application. You also learned how to send events to the machine and subscribe to state changes to update the UI.

Next, we'll learn how to model more complex state machines with compound states and parallel states.
