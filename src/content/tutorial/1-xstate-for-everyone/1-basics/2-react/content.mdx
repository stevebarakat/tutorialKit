## Incorporating TypeScript and React

In this lesson, we'll integrate XState with React using the `useMachine` hook provided by the `@xstate/react` package. This hook provides the current state and a `send` function to send events to the machine.

We'll also use the "setup" function from the `@xstate/fsm` package to define the event type for the machine.

#### Code

Here's the TypeScript version of the machine we created in the first lesson:

```ts
setup({
  types: {
    events: {} as { type: "switch" },
  },
}).createMachine({
  initial: "Off",
  states: {
    Off: {
      on: {
        switch: {
          target: "On",
        },
      },
    },
    On: {
      on: {
        switch: {
          target: "Off",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Instead of using the `createActor` function, we'll use the `useMachine` hook provided by the `@xstate/react` package. This hook returns the current state and a `send` function to send events to the machine.

```js
import { machine } from "./machine";
import { useMachine } from "@xstate/react";

function App() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => send({ type: "switch" })}>
      {state.matches("On") ? "On" : "Off"}
    </button>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### Key Points

- We use the `useMachine` hook to get the current state and the `send` function.
- We `send` the "switch" event when the button is clicked.
- We're using the `matches` method to check if the current state matches a specific state. This is useful for conditionally rendering UI elements based on the current state of the machine.
- We update the button's text based on the current state.

##### In Practice

You can see an example of this in the code editor to you right. Click the button in the preview panel to toggle betweeen states. Notice how the button's text changes from "On" to "Off" and back again, reflecting the current state of the machine.

#### Exercise

1. Change the event type from "switch" to "toggle" in the machine definition.
2. Update the event type in the `send` method to match the new event type.
3. Test the changes by clicking the button in the preview panel.
4. Change the the name of the first state from "Off" to "Inactive" and the second state from "On" to "Active".
5. Update the button's text to reflect the new state names.
6. Test the changes by clicking the button in the preview panel.

#### Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to integrate XState with React using the `useMachine` hook. This hook provides the current state and a `send` function to send events to the machine.
